# How to use the lectures



- Slides are made with [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1)

- `r fa("search")` In the bottom left there is a search tool which will search all content of presentation

- Control + F will also search 

- Press enter to move to the next result 

- `r fa("pencil-alt")` In the top right let's you draw on the slides, although these aren't saved.

- Pressing the letter `o` (for overview) will allow you to see an overview of the whole presentation and go to a slide

- Alternatively just typing the slide number e.g. 10 on the website will take you to that slide

- Pressing alt+F will fit the slide to the screen, this is useful if you have resized the window and have another open - side by side.

# Air pollution and LULC 2


> There is no doubt that the LULC distribution significantly affects the MAP and LST. Therefore, to determine this relationship the latest LULC distribution shape-file was acquired from the National Cartographic Center of Iran (NCC)

--

> To figure out the impact of LULC on the LST and MAP (Major Air Pollutants) the following statistical comparison perform, the LULC was chosen as an independent variable whereas LST, PM₂.₅, SO₂, NO₂, CO, and O₃ are considered as dependent variables


Although this wasn't used in regression...that was just for the scatter plots of the variables...

But we have classified data (or we might) from a national center

# Decision and classification trees (CART) 3

We can either:
* limit how trees grow (e.g. a minimum number of pixels in a leaf)
* prune the tree:
  * calculate the sum of the squared residuals (SSR, like linear regression) for each leaf
  * Sum for the tree
  * Tree score = SSR + tree penalty (alpha) * T (number of leaves)

Alpha: use a full size tree (with **all** data), start with a value of 0 then increase until pruning gives lower tree score. 

Different alpha gives us different sizes of tree that we can test with cross validation.

We divide this up into sections based on thresholds (nodes) and calculate the sum of the squared residuals...

We can then check the SSR for different thresholds...**the one with the lowest SSR is the root of the tree to start with**...then repeat

To prevent over fitting we can set **a minimum number of observations before splitting the data again**.

* Grow many classification decision trees - **Many better than one**
* Each tree classifies a pixel - it votes for that class, most votes is the winner

The Sendai Framework Focal Points in each country are responsible of data reporting through the Sendai Framework Monitoring System.

* 11.5.3 National disaster loss database, reported to UNISDR...**Not every country has a comparable national disaster loss database that is consistent with these guidelines** (although current coverage exceeds 89 countries). Therefore, by 2020, it is expected that all countries will build/adjust national disaster loss databases according to the recommendations and guidelines by the OEIWG.

All about monitoring, doesn't say how to do it...but this is changing

# Global policy documents

Some new additions that have included spatial data...e.g...

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Target 11.7]

By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities

* Indicator 11.7.1: Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities

> Satellite imagery (open sources), documentation outlining publicly owned land and community-based maps are the main sources of data.

But...

> High resolution satellite imagery or Google Earth imagery can be used in this analysis. Open data sources such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) have some polygon data on open spaces in many cities

]

.panel[.panel-name[Target 11.6]

By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management

* Indicator 11.6.2: Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted)

> Sources of data include ground measurements from monitoring networks, collected for 3,000 cities and localities (WHO 2016) around the world, satellite remote sensing, population estimates...

> estimated with improved modelling using data integration from satellite remote sensing, population estimates, topography and ground measurements (WHO, 2016a; Shaddick et al, 2016)

* The paper by Shaddick is hard to follow with no code.

.panel[.panel-name[Reflections]

These are two examples but comment on the complexity of the approaches..

* Who are they targeted at, what end user
* Who could replicate them
* Are they useful - how could the results be used

# Metropolitan policy documents

Under the theme of disaster (flooding, landslides, drought, heatwaves etc)

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[London]

**Increasing efficiency and resilience**

* These environmental threats are real and present, and London must be prepared for them. London’s homes and infrastructure must be protected against the increasing likelihood of heatwaves, and developments must plan for a more integrated approach to water management, while minimising flood risk.


**Policy SI 12 Flood risk management **

* Development Plans should use the Mayor’s Regional Flood Risk Appraisal and their Strategic Flood Risk Assessment as well as Local Flood Risk Management Strategies, where necessary, to identify areas where particular and cumulative flood risk issues exist and develop actions and policy
approaches aimed at reducing these risks.

# Local policy documents

In most of the previous examples the documents were created by the metropolitan government:
  * Greater London Authority 
  * Amdavad Municipal Corporation
  * City of New York

Usually these are considered an upper tier

They set the strategic plan for the city and may have other responsibilities such as fire, policing, transport and development guidelines.

Lower tier government then carries out or adheres to these goals, for example....

* The Western Australian Planning Commission sets the statutory planning guidance that is carried out by local cities, such as the City of Perth and City of Fremantle.

* The Greater London Authority set the strategic goals for London with London Boroughs providing local services.

# Local policy documents 2

**BUT** there are variations to this rule..

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[City of Cape Town]

* The City of Cape Town is a metropolitan municipality or Category A municipality, there is no local municipality below it.

* However, **above** the City of Cape Town is the Provincial government that is responsible for topics such as: agriculture, education, health and public housing. As such the City sets it's own development plan and then implements it (whilst adhering to relevant Provincial topics).

]

.panel[.panel-name[New York]


* City of New York is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services

* 5 Boroughs under it act as spokespeople

* City Council has 51 members from districts of about 157,000 
* New York City is responsible for setting and enacting the policy. State government is above it.

# Task 1

For the individual assignment of the module you are required to produce a online portfolio of independent study and response questions. 

For the practical session this week **come** prepared **to talk** about the following:

- Search for one metropolitan policy challenge (any city in the World) that could be solved by incorporating remotely sensed data

- Identify and evaluate a remotely sensed data set that could used to assist with contributing to the policy goal

-  Demonstrate how this links to global agendas / goals

- Explain how it advances current local, national or global approaches.

Cities will have a diverse range of documentation available...

---
# Task 2

Following the practical and subsequent discussion write up your case study city in three paragraphs, you should:

* Detail the relevant policy that can be assisted with remotely sensed data
* Evaluate how remotely sensed data set(s) could used to assist with contributing to the policy goal
* Place it within local / global agendas and current approaches
* Cite the relevant policy and where appropriate literature.

Should you struggle to find current approaches within your city explore other cities discussed within the practical.
