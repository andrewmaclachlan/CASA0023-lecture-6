# How to use the lectures



- Slides are made with [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1)

- `r fa("search")` In the bottom left there is a search tool which will search all content of presentation

- Control + F will also search 

- Press enter to move to the next result 

- `r fa("pencil-alt")` In the top right let's you draw on the slides, although these aren't saved.

- Pressing the letter `o` (for overview) will allow you to see an overview of the whole presentation and go to a slide

- Alternatively just typing the slide number e.g. 10 on the website will take you to that slide

- Pressing alt+F will fit the slide to the screen, this is useful if you have resized the window and have another open - side by side.

"Three SAR images acquired by the ERS satellite during 5 May, 9 June and 14 July in 1996 are assigned to the red, green and blue channels respectively for display. The colourful areas are the rice growing areas, where the landcovers change rapidly during the rice season. The greyish linear features are the more permanent trees lining the canals. The grey patch near the bottom of the image is wetland forest. The two towns appear as bright white spots in this image. An area of depression flooded with water during this season is visible as a dark region."

# SAR background 4

Some terms:   

> Backscatter is the portion of the outgoing radar signal that the target redirects directly back towards the radar antenna

The higher the backscattered intensity = rougher the surface. It is "unitless"

Can be converted to "backscatter coefficient, or sigma nought", measured in decibel (dB) units = normalised measure of the radar return from a distributed target 

If the signal is from backscatter is not desired = "clutter"

* Has been used in urban monitoring BUT...

  * Corner reflections in urban environments 
  * Shadowing - building behind another not imaged 
  * Speckle - grainy, from scattering on ground - "salt and pepper"

# Me on SAR

> Although SAR images over urban areas provide low quality images due to problems associated with radar imaging in such an environment (i.e. multiple bouncing, layover and shadowing), SAR texture measures can provide valuable information in discerning urban areas (Dell’Acqua et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2012). Isolated scattering of residential areas and crowded backscatters of inner city high density areas permit classification refinement, thus textural measures such as those descried within the spatial domain can aid identification of alternative urban forms (Zhu et al., 2012). 

>However, the lack of freely available SAR data that temporally coincides with other satellite imagery (e.g. Landsat) frequently precludes extensive use

# InSAR

Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)
 * Take two RADAR observations of the target (e.g. the ground)
 * The two 
 * Use the phase difference 
 * Phase = 
  > "total number of cycles of the wave at any given distance from the transmitter, including the fractional part"

* Phase difference - SUBTRACT the values (measured phase values) at two different measurement points

* Differential distance depends on the height of the terrain (topography)

* Used for creating DEMs

* Monitoring displacement of ground - earthquakes etc

# Monitoring forests + illegal logging 

**Sensor**

* Landsat (2000 to 2012)

Monitoring forest loss and illegal logging 

* Pre-processing

> "Landsat pre-processing steps included: (i) image resampling, (ii) conversion of raw
digital values (DN) to top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, (iii) cloud/shadow/water
screening and quality assessment (QA), and (iv) image normalization"

> The stack of QA layers was used to create a perpixel set of cloud-free image observations which in turn was employed to calculate timeseries spectral metrics.

---

# Monitoring forests + illegal logging 2

* Creating metrics

> Metrics represent a generic feature space that facilitates regionalscale mapping and have been used extensively with MODIS and AVHRR data

> (i) reflectance values representing maximum, minimum and selected percentile values 
  (ii) mean reflectance values for observations between selected percentiles
  (iii) slope of linear regression of band reflectance value versus
image date.

In support of this reference is given to [Hansen et al. 2010](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.0912668107)...supplementary material...

> The time-sequential MODIS 32-dayinputs were transformed to annual metrics to produce a more generalized feature space

# Monitoring forests + illegal logging 3

> "a more generalized feature space"

# Monitoring forests + illegal logging 6

> Decision trees are hierarchical classifiers that predict class membership by recursively partitioning a data set into more homogeneous or less varying subsets, referred to as nodes

* Decision trees are part of a random forest classier

* Take something complex and force into many decisions = if-else conditions or also called divide and conquer.

* Often requires hyperparameters to train the model (or  control the learning process) - e.g. the choices we've made in the past...sort of...
  * DBSCAN (radius of points, Epsilon or MinPts - to make a cluster)
  * Spatial weight matrix (type and then weight)

* Split the data into more and more homogeneous subsets (filtering!) this can be limited through
  * pre-pruning - set a number of iterations before
  * post-pruning - reduce groups afterwards based on accuracy.

## Only the severity which wasn't even overlaid directly

## The study was somewhat confusing with a focus on severity (the aim) which then changed to a fire action plan that didn't show severity as a factor

.panel[.panel-name[Target 11.5]

* Target 11.5: By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations

.panel[.panel-name[Data 11.5]
* 11.5.1 (and .2) Data provider at national level is appointed Sendai Framework Focal Points. In most countries disaster **data are collected by line ministries and national disaster loss databases are established and managed by special purpose agencies including national disaster management agencies, civil protection agencies, and meteorological agencies**. The Sendai Framework Focal Points in each country are responsible of data reporting through the Sendai Framework Monitoring System.

* 11.5.3 National disaster loss database, reported to UNISDR...**Not every country has a comparable national disaster loss database that is consistent with these guidelines** (although current coverage exceeds 89 countries). Therefore, by 2020, it is expected that all countries will build/adjust national disaster loss databases according to the recommendations and guidelines by the OEIWG.

* Indicator 11.7.1: Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities

> Satellite imagery (open sources), documentation outlining publicly owned land and community-based maps are the main sources of data.

But...

> High resolution satellite imagery or Google Earth imagery can be used in this analysis. Open data sources such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) have some polygon data on open spaces in many cities

.panel[.panel-name[Target 11.6]

By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management

* Indicator 11.6.2: Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted)

> Sources of data include ground measurements from monitoring networks, collected for 3,000 cities and localities (WHO 2016) around the world, satellite remote sensing, population estimates...

> estimated with improved modelling using data integration from satellite remote sensing, population estimates, topography and ground measurements (WHO, 2016a; Shaddick et al, 2016)

**Increasing efficiency and resilience**

* These environmental threats are real and present, and London must be prepared for them. London’s homes and infrastructure must be protected against the increasing likelihood of heatwaves, and developments must plan for a more integrated approach to water management, while minimising flood risk.


**Policy SI 12 Flood risk management **

* Development Plans should use the Mayor’s Regional Flood Risk Appraisal and their Strategic Flood Risk Assessment as well as Local Flood Risk Management Strategies, where necessary, to identify areas where particular and cumulative flood risk issues exist and develop actions and policy
approaches aimed at reducing these risks.

# Local policy documents

In most of the previous examples the documents were created by the metropolitan government:
  * Greater London Authority 
  * Amdavad Municipal Corporation
  * City of New York

Usually these are considered an upper tier

They set the strategic plan for the city and may have other responsibilities such as fire, policing, transport and development guidelines.

Lower tier government then carries out or adheres to these goals, for example....

* The Western Australian Planning Commission sets the statutory planning guidance that is carried out by local cities, such as the City of Perth and City of Fremantle.

* The Greater London Authority set the strategic goals for London with London Boroughs providing local services.

# Local policy documents 2

**BUT** there are variations to this rule..

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[City of Cape Town]

* The City of Cape Town is a metropolitan municipality or Category A municipality, there is no local municipality below it.

* However, **above** the City of Cape Town is the Provincial government that is responsible for topics such as: agriculture, education, health and public housing. As such the City sets it's own development plan and then implements it (whilst adhering to relevant Provincial topics).

]

.panel[.panel-name[New York]


* City of New York is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services

* 5 Boroughs under it act as spokespeople

* City Council has 51 members from districts of about 157,000 
* New York City is responsible for setting and enacting the policy. State government is above it.

# Task 1

For the individual assignment of the module you are required to produce a online portfolio of independent study and response questions. 

For the practical session this week **come** prepared **to talk** about the following:

- Search for one metropolitan policy challenge (any city in the World) that could be solved by incorporating remotely sensed data

- Identify and evaluate a remotely sensed data set that could used to assist with contributing to the policy goal

-  Demonstrate how this links to global agendas / goals

- Explain how it advances current local, national or global approaches.

Cities will have a diverse range of documentation available...

---
# Task 2

Following the practical and subsequent discussion write up your case study city in three paragraphs, you should:

* Detail the relevant policy that can be assisted with remotely sensed data
* Evaluate how remotely sensed data set(s) could used to assist with contributing to the policy goal
* Place it within local / global agendas and current approaches
* Cite the relevant policy and where appropriate literature.

Should you struggle to find current approaches within your city explore other cities discussed within the practical.
