- Pressing the letter `o` (for overview) will allow you to see an overview of the whole presentation and go to a slide

- Alternatively just typing the slide number e.g. 10 on the website will take you to that slide

- Pressing alt+F will fit the slide to the screen, this is useful if you have resized the window and have another open - side by side.

# Before we can explore policy we really need to look at what remotely sensed data can provide answers to...

class: inverse, center, middle

# So...a brief overview...but of course this depends on the data you are using

# Data from sensors

Depends on a the combination of spectral bands,  resolutions + cost.

.pull-left[

* Multi-temporal land cover (or land use) mapping 

* Spectral signatures / libraries* 

* Change detection - e.g. urban or forest 

* Vegetation stress - illegal logging 

* Precipitation 

* Elevation models (or point data) - such as LiDAR

* Temperature 

* Night time lights (urban development)
]

.pull-right[

* Forest fire monitoring / predicting / "hot spot" detecting 

* Pollution monitoring 

* Drought indices

* Informal housing detection

* Water level data - monitoring 

* Building or network outline (polygon / line) extraction

* Environmental monitoring (e.g. Aral Sea)

* Estimations of resources - forest, water, snow, ice, green space

# SAR background 4

Some terms:   

&gt; Backscatter is the portion of the outgoing radar signal that the target redirects directly back towards the radar antenna

The higher the backscattered intensity = rougher the surface. It is "unitless"

Can be converted to "backscatter coefficient, or sigma nought", measured in decibel (dB) units = normalised measure of the radar return from a distributed target 

If the signal is from backscatter is not desired = "clutter"

* Has been used in urban monitoring BUT...

  * Corner reflections in urban environments 
  * Shadowing - building behind another not imaged 
  * Speckle - grainy, from scattering on ground - "salt and pepper"

# Me on SAR

&gt; Although SAR images over urban areas provide low quality images due to problems associated with radar imaging in such an environment (i.e. multiple bouncing, layover and shadowing), SAR texture measures can provide valuable information in discerning urban areas (Dell’Acqua et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2012). Isolated scattering of residential areas and crowded backscatters of inner city high density areas permit classification refinement, thus textural measures such as those descried within the spatial domain can aid identification of alternative urban forms (Zhu et al., 2012). 

&gt;However, the lack of freely available SAR data that temporally coincides with other satellite imagery (e.g. Landsat) frequently precludes extensive use

# InSAR

Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)
 * Take two RADAR observations of the target (e.g. the ground)
 * The two 
 * Use the phase difference 
 * Phase = 
  &gt; "total number of cycles of the wave at any given distance from the transmitter, including the fractional part"

* Phase difference - SUBTRACT the values (measured phase values) at two different measurement points

* Differential distance depends on the height of the terrain (topography)

* Used for creating DEMs

* Monitoring displacement of ground - earthquakes etc

# Monitoring forests + illegal logging 

**Sensor**

* Landsat (2000 to 2012)

Monitoring forest loss and illegal logging 

* Pre-processing

&gt; "Landsat pre-processing steps included: (i) image resampling, (ii) conversion of raw
digital values (DN) to top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, (iii) cloud/shadow/water
screening and quality assessment (QA), and (iv) image normalization"

&gt; The stack of QA layers was used to create a perpixel set of cloud-free image observations which in turn was employed to calculate timeseries spectral metrics.

# Monitoring forests + illegal logging 2

* Creating metrics

&gt; Metrics represent a generic feature space that facilitates regionalscale mapping and have been used extensively with MODIS and AVHRR data

&gt; (i) reflectance values representing maximum, minimum and selected percentile values 
  (ii) mean reflectance values for observations between selected percentiles
  (iii) slope of linear regression of band reflectance value versus
image date.

In support of this reference is given to [Hansen et al. 2010](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.0912668107)...supplementary material...

&gt; The time-sequential MODIS 32-dayinputs were transformed to annual metrics to produce a more generalized feature space

&gt; Decision trees are hierarchical classifiers that predict class membership by recursively partitioning a data set into more homogeneous or less varying subsets, referred to as nodes

* Decision trees are part of a random forest classier

* Take something complex and force into many decisions = if-else conditions or also called divide and conquer.

* Often requires hyperparameters to train the model (or  control the learning process) - e.g. the choices we've made in the past...sort of...
  * DBSCAN (radius of points, Epsilon or MinPts - to make a cluster)
  * Spatial weight matrix (type and then weight)

* Split the data into more and more homogeneous subsets (filtering!) this can be limited through
  * pre-pruning - set a number of iterations before
  * post-pruning - reduce groups afterwards based on accuracy.

# Task 1

For the individual assignment of the module you are required to produce a online portfolio of independent study and response questions. 

For the practical session this week **come** prepared **to talk** about the following:

- Search for one metropolitan policy challenge (any city in the World) that could be solved by incorporating remotely sensed data

- Identify and evaluate a remotely sensed data set that could used to assist with contributing to the policy goal

-  Demonstrate how this links to global agendas / goals

- Explain how it advances current local, national or global approaches.

Cities will have a diverse range of documentation available...

---
# Task 2

Following the practical and subsequent discussion write up your case study city in three paragraphs, you should:

* Detail the relevant policy that can be assisted with remotely sensed data
* Evaluate how remotely sensed data set(s) could used to assist with contributing to the policy goal
* Place it within local / global agendas and current approaches
* Cite the relevant policy and where appropriate literature.

Should you struggle to find current approaches within your city explore other cities discussed within the practical.
